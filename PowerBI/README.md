# Microsoft Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is used in this project as a data visualisation tool. 

## Overview

An overview page was created in order to introduce the main statistical data and act as a welcome page to navigate to the other main dashboards. In this intro, the time span is indicated, the total tracks sales and revenue, as well as some demographics on the associated customer countries and artists sold.

Two dynamic links lead to the other dashboards.

A slicer is located in both pages in order to dynamically filter the data based on year and month. It narrows the dataset shown in all the page’s visualisations in order to easily locate progress, combine data and make comparisons. It can be navigated either via the slicer box or the visualisation itself by clicking on a diagram’s data.

## Revenue

In the revenue page, the data shown refers to the revenue, to the quantity sold and investigates countries and customers in accordance to the money received or the tracks sold. Specifically, the progress of revenue and items sold is determined on a yearly basis. Moreover, total sums are investigated. It is important to filter the top 5 customers that spent the most in the company and also, the location of each customer in order to help a possible marketing strategy.

## Tracks

In the tracks and employees page, the data focus on showing various internal issues. Specifically, one of the most important is employee performance and the top employee is used either of all time or by month. The number of invoices printed is used as an indicator on how much a customer spends per transaction. Furthermore, in order to track and promote old and new investments artists, albums and genre is examined providing the best selling numbers for each category.
